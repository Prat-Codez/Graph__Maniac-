Multiple Equations: Plot several functions simultaneously on the same canvas for easy comparison.

Dynamic Input: Easily add new equation input fields or remove existing ones.

Interactive Navigation: Zoom in and out using dedicated buttons, or pan across the graph by dragging your mouse.

Responsive Design: The interface adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Engaging UI: Enjoy a modern, dark-themed design with subtle hover effects for a more interactive experience.

üöÄ How to Use

Open in Browser: Simply open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

Enter Equations:

The app starts with a few example equations.

Click the "Add Equation" button to get a new input field.

Type your equations (e.g., y = x**2, y = sin(x), x = y**2). Use ** or ^ for exponentiation (e.g., x**2 or x^2).

The graph will update automatically as you type.

Interact:

Click the + and - buttons to zoom in and out.

Click and drag on the graph area to pan the view.

Click the trashcan icon next to an equation to remove it.
